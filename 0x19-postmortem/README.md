## Postmortem: Apache 500 Error Resolution and Automation with Puppet

**Incident ID**: WEB-500-ERR

**Date**: June 4, 2024

**Duration**: 1 hour

**Impact**: High - All users experienced a 500 Internal Server Error

### Summary

Our Apache web server began returning a 500 Internal Server Error to all visitors. The issue was promptly investigated using `strace`, which revealed a misconfiguration in the `.htaccess` file. The error was corrected, and the resolution process was automated using Puppet, replacing the previous Bash scripts.

### Timeline

- **14:00 GMT**: Reports received about users encountering 500 errors on the website.
- **14:05 GMT**: Incident team assembled and began using `strace` to diagnose the issue.
- **14:15 GMT**: `strace` output indicated an error in the `.htaccess` file parsing.
- **14:20 GMT**: The specific misconfiguration was identified as an invalid rewrite rule.
- **14:30 GMT**: Manual fix applied to the `.htaccess` file and service restored.
- **14:45 GMT**: Decision made to automate the fix using Puppet for consistency and scalability.
- **15:00 GMT**: Puppet manifest created and applied across all servers.
- **15:10 GMT**: Full service functionality confirmed, monitoring continued.

### Root Cause

The root cause was an invalid syntax in the `.htaccess` file’s rewrite rule, which was not compatible with the current version of Apache. This caused the server to return a 500 error for all requests.

### Resolution and Recovery

The `.htaccess` file was corrected manually, and a Puppet manifest was written to automate the deployment of this configuration to prevent future occurrences.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Code Review**: Implemented a mandatory code review process for any changes to `.htaccess` files.
- **Puppet Automation**: Developed Puppet manifests to manage `.htaccess` configurations across all servers.
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring to detect 500 errors and trigger immediate alerts.

### Puppet Manifest Example

```
file { '/var/www/html/.htaccess':
  ensure  => 'file',
  content => template('apache/htaccess.erb'),
  owner   => 'www-data',
  group   => 'www-data',
  mode    => '0644',
}

```

### Conclusion

This incident highlighted the need for rigorous configuration management and the benefits of infrastructure automation. By transitioning to Puppet, we have increased our ability to manage configurations consistently and reduced the risk of human error.
